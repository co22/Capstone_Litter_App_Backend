How to run the Flask project:

1. Open the virtual environment venv (it should have flask and other necessary imports already installed).
- Go to the venv folder and run activate to open the virtual environment. (venv) should be displayed above your username in the CLI.
- Make sure the python interpreter version is set to 3.9.1.
2. Run Flask by using the command: flask run. Use flask run --host=0.0.0.0 to allow other devices (such as the android tablet) to connect to it.

- Note: must be in virtual environment to run, since flask/imports are installed on there.
